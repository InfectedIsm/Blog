Hey, that's me **Infect3d**, you also may know me as [@InfectedCrypto](https://twitter.com/InfectedCrypto) on Twitter.
I started web3 security as a hobby, now doing it for a living.

I'm currently focusing on **EVM smart contract security**, sharpening my skills [through contests](https://github.com/InfectedIsm/Reports-Portfolio).

In this era of full digitalization, now more than ever, blockchain technology is a victory for freedom
and humanity, that must be protected and cherished.
Just as p2p file sharing hands access to culture for everyone, and Tor-like networks protects
individual liberties against potential authoritarian overreach, **blockchain give back control to people over their monetary assets and data**.

And here I am, trying to secure those projects as best as I can.

Hope you'll enjoy the blog! Feel free to contact me through my social medias, I'll be glad to discuss on any topics with you.
